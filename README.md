## Introduction

This project provides a Python solution for extracting relevant data from PDF invoices. It addresses challenges like multi-page documents and variable formats, ensuring a reliable extraction process.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or later
- Required libraries: `re` for regular expressions, `json` for data handling
- (Optional) Any PDF library if you want to extend functionality for real PDF extraction.


## Parts Overview

### Part 1: Understanding Requirements and Data Structure

In this part, we analyze the structure of the PDF invoice to identify key fields for extraction. We focus on both header information (like Invoice Number and Date) and table data (like Service Description and Total Amount).

### Part 2: Creating a Template for Data Extraction

We create a template for data extraction using Python and regular expressions. Each field in the invoice is defined with rules for extraction, enabling us to systematically gather the required information.

### Part 3: Debugging and Improving Extraction Logic

In this section, we identify potential bugs in our extraction logic, especially concerning variations in data formats (e.g., different ways of expressing the invoice amount). We refine our code to handle multiple formats effectively.

### Part 4: Template Optimization for Efficiency

Here, we optimize our template to handle variations across different vendors. By using regex patterns, we generalize our extraction rules, reducing the need for vendor-specific templates and improving overall efficiency.

### Part 5: Dealing with Complex Scenarios

In the final part, we tackle complex scenarios such as:
- **Multi-page extraction**: Handling invoices where headers and tables are on different pages.
- **Multi-line table rows**: Managing long descriptions that may wrap onto the next line.
- **Advanced error handling**: Ensuring that the program does not crash and provides meaningful fallback values when data is missing or inconsistent.
